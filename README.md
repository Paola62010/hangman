# Hangman

Hangman is a Python terminal game that runs on Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

This classic game will bring you back in time, to when we used to play it on paper.

## How to play

The aim of the game is to guess the hidden word. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, each one replacing a letter of the word. 

With each turn the player can either guess the entire word or a letter. If the guess is correct, the dash will be replaced with the gussed letter. 

The player has 7 lives. With each incorrect guess, one life is subtracted and one element of the hangman stick figure is drawn. 

The game ends when either the player guesses the word or no more lives remain.
